TODO: 
    - Finish up memory system. 
    - Once memory system is verified, finish the processor FSM 
    - Complete the issuer (also finalize cmd_t format)
    - Thorough verification of individual components 
    - Combine modules and verify entire system(write a python script to multiple matrix multiplications)
Notes: 
    - When proc finishes it could be a multicycle thing to go through scoreboard
