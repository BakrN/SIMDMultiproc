TODO: 
    - Finish up memory system. (check)
    - Once memory system is verified, finish the processor FSM  (check)
    - Complete the issuer (also finalize cmd_t format) (completed issuer)
    - Thorough verification of individual components (check)
    - Combine modules and verify entire system(write a python script to multiple matrix multiplications) (WIP)
    - Test issuer without acknowledgement (wastes a few cycles at start (could save time in later cmds)) - need to experiment (not priority)
    - Top module to test entire workflow (WIP)
Notes: 
    - When proc finishes it could be a multicycle thing to go through scoreboard
